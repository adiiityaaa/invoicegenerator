# Invoice-Generator:
An Invoice Generator which uses ejs+css for frontend and js for backend.
# Initialization:
This repository is ready to use with some basic changes:
1. This project was developed on Pterodactyl, hence uses [SFTP Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ssh2-sftp-client) as well as [Multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) for file management.
2. Fork the repository.
3. Modify the SMTP as well as SFTP details. Advisable to use SFTP as it is ready to use, else you'll need to recode the index.
4. Run the project. Accessible at localhost:4974. Modify as per the needs.
5. This project is based on [Microinvoice](https://www.npmjs.com/package/microinvoice).
# Credits:
